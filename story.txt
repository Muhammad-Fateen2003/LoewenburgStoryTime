There I was, driving my BMW down the autobahn at 300kph. 
I was jamming to my favorite industrial metal band Rammstein and dreaming of enjoying beer when I arrive at Oktoberfest.
Suddenly, after turning onto Berlin's Hauptstrasse, I realized it was only March, and Oktoberfest is in.... October! 
I then decided I could do a ratskeller crawl instead.
Driving down Hauptstrasse in my Porsche, I couldn't resist the aroma of fresh Brot emanating from the Baeckerei on the corner, so I pulled over to buy some Gebaeck.
